You can use following plugin to edit any model text field in any app under a django project without writing additional views or urls.

To use this:

1) include following  script in the html page
      <script type="text/javascript" src="/django_extensions_project/static/js/editinplace.js"></script>

      2) Change the class and id of the element you want to edit to, 
      class = "editinplace_text" 
      id = <id of the element>__<full modulename>__<modelname>__<fieldname>
      Example:
      <td class="editinplace_text" id="{{image.id}}__collegeweb.mechanicalengg.models__Lab__name">{{image.prefix}}</ td>

      If it is a boolean field, use 
       class = "editinplace_selectbox" instead.
